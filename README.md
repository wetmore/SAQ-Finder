SAQ Finder
==========

Find nearby SAQ stores, and access info about the nearby stores. For the moment it is merely a work-in-progress. 

SAQ, or Société des alcools du Québec, is responsible for the sale of alcoholic beverages in Quebec. While supermarkets and cornerstores can sell wine and beer, anything with a higher alcohol content is available only at an SAQ store (we call them SAQs). As the only providers of bacchanalian beverages, the location of the closest open SAQ is of great interest to college students. 

Unfortunately, the official SAQ store finder on their site kinda sucks. Thus, the inspiration for this application - an easier, quicker way to figure out where you can pick up your supplies for the night. 

As I mentioned, the application is still in its early stages.
